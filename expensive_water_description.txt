First, I downloaded a dataset that seems to list the expenditures of members of the House of Representatives 
for their Washington and and district offices in the first quarter of 2017. (https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures). 
Second, I filtered all expenses with the purpose water and an amount above 1000 using the python script. 
For doing so, I piped stdout from curl as stdin into the python file, where I assigned it the variable data. 
Then, I used the csv libarary to create a csv reader and a writer. Then, I looped through all rows and if the 
condition that the purpose is water and the amount is above 1000 was met, I added the row. The resulting csv 
became stdout was redirected to expensive_water.csv.
Third, I created summary statistics using csvstat. I did this by piping expensive_water.csv into csvstat and
then redirecting the output into expensive_water_summary.txt
