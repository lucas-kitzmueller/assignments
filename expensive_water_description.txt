First, I downloaded a dataset that seems to list the expenditures of members of the House of Representatives 
for their Washington and and district offices in the first quarter of 2017. (https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures). 
Second, I filtered all expenses with the purpose water and an amount above 1000 using the python script.
Third, I created summary statistics using csvstat.
